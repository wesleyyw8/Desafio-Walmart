1 - Go to nodejs.org and download v4.3.0 lts version of nodejs and install it.

3 - git clone https://github.com/wesleyyw8/Desafio-Walmart.git
4 - npm install package.json
caso der erro, npm install express -save-dev
5 - bower install -g bower
5.1 - cd ui
5.2 - bower install
6 - Open up Nodejs Prompt and type "node server.js"
if you receive a message "We have started our server on port 3000!" you did it! just type localhost:3000 on your browser!


Im using nodejs as a server because it has javascript syntax so it is easier for me. 
Bower.json is for UI libraries and framewroks in the other hand package.json is for nodeJS modules.
Im using angularJS because it is a powerfull framework and I have a lot of experience with it. It wouldnt be necessary to use angularjs to develope this website but it makes things easier if I need to change something in the future!
